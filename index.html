                    Hi all! I'm Rodnee. I was born in Denver, CO but have been in Phoenix since March of 2006.
                    I'm an avid sports fan; I still support my Denver teams. Die hard Bronco fan! Played a little
                    college
                    football back in the day at Idaho State University. I was a defensive-back. I love the Colorado
                    Rockies, Denver Nuggets, and Colorado Avalanche as well. I also love to play golf! I'm in the
                    right
                    city
                    for that! I have around a 10 handicap.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm almost finished with a Master's degree in Cybersecurity; and I'm adding to my toolbelt with
                    this
                    class. I love to learn technology, and am sure this class will really help me find that career
                    I'm
                    hoping for.
                    <br>
                    I'm a single guy with an older brother, younger sister and brother.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, I drive for Lyft and Uber. Between my twp "schools" I don't have time to work
                    -full-time;
                    and this way I have good flexibility. I can work when I want, or rather, when I can. The
                    flexibility
                    is important, as I value my performance in school. It's also nice to set my own hours, and be
                    my own
                    boss.
                    I'm pretty easy on myself! It works out well on class days. Because I live way up in Desert
                    Ridge, I
                    just
                    work during the day; and when it gets to be afternoon, set my destination for Gilbert. That
                    way, by the
                    time
                    class starts I'm already nearby, and was paid to get to class!
